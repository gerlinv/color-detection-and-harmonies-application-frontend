# Color Detection and Harmonies App Frontend

An application which makes it possible to identify colors
from pictures and find how harmonious two chosen colors are.

## Frontend
To start the frontend application type the following in your
terminal:
```
npm install (only if you're running the application for the first time!)
expo start
```
If you want to use the application on your phone replace API_URL in
frontend/components/Global.js with your IPV4 address and type in the terminal the next command:
```
expo start --tunnel 
```
Once the command has been inserted, wait until the QR-code appears. 
If you want to see the application in your web browser, simply type in the letter "w".
If you want to use the application on your phone:
1. On Android install the Expo Go app and scan the QR code.
2. On iPhone or iPad scan the QR code with the default Apple "Camera" app.
